 Agriculture is an important sector of the Indian economy. The Indian agriculture sector employs nearly half of the country's workforce. India is widely regarded as the world's leading producer of pulses, rice, wheat, spices, and spice products. Farmers' economic growth is dependent on the quality of their products, which is dependent on plant growth and yield. As a result, in the field of agriculture, disease detection in plants is critical. Plants are highly susceptible to diseases that affect plant growth, which in turn affects the farmer's ecology. The use of an automatic disease detection technique is advantageous in detecting a plant disease at an early stage. Plant diseases manifest themselves in various parts of the plant, such as leaves. Manually detecting plant disease using leaf images is a time-consuming task. As a result, it is necessary to develop computational methods that will automate the process of disease detection and classification using leaf images.
